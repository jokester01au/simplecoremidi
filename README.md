simplecoremidi
==============

A fork of the [simplecoremidi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplecoremidi) python package that allows you to directly send and receive data to/from external devices.

TODO
----

  - Unbreak the original functionality that allowed you to create virtual endpoints
  - "hijack" ports to prevent messages from being propagated to other endpoints
